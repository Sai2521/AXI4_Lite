Introduction to AXI4-Lite (Advanced Extensible Interface)
Advanced eXtensible Interface 4 (AXI4) is a family of buses defined as part of the fourth generation of the ARM Advanced Microcontroler Bus Architectrue (AMBA) standard. AXI was first introduced with the third generation of AMBA, as AXI3, in 1996.

The AMBA specification defines 3 AXI4 protocols:

AXI4: A high performance memory mapped data and address interface. Capable of Burst access to memory mapped devices.
<rd>
AXI4-Lite: A subset of AXI, lacking burst access capability. Has a simpler interface than the full AXI4 interface.
<rd>
AXI4-Stream: A fast unidirectional protocol for transfering data from master to slave.
